# fiactivity
Quick and dirty script to fetch data from Fi and send to Prometheus. A much more elegant solution would be to add an API endpoint to [pytryfi](https://github.com/sbabcock23/pytryfi) and use that. Ideally this solution should properly use their pagination. However, until I have time to learn the basics of GraphQL this script will suffice.
